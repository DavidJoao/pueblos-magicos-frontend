# Pueblos Magicos

After looking around for websites and web apps that were focused on providing details about Mexico's Pueblos Magicos, and not being able to find a page with the information I needed, I decided to create a website that allows me to show each town with a short description and images. 

In this website people are able to scroll and navigate through all 132 Pueblos Magicos that exist.

Also, I created an admin panel that allows me to create, delete and edit the information from my database if needed.

## Technologies used: 
- MongoDB
- TypeScript
- NodeJS
- Tailwind CSS
- ExpressJS


## `Site screenshots`

The detail modal provides a short description about the town and includes a few so the visitor can take a look at them.

![hover](/assets/hover.png)
Visitor are able to hover over the images to look at them more in detail, when they hover over it, the photograph expands to a considerable size.

Also, there is a filter that is very useful in case the visitor is looking for a specific town.

The administrator panel is used to create a town and add it to the database, to delete, and to update a town if necessary. To use it there is a code required.


## `Future implementations`

After finishing the first version, I have planned to create forms to sign up and log in, so users can leave reviews on each town. This would be using PassportJS and OAuth authentication, and it would be implemented also in the administration panel.
